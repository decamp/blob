THE BLOB LIBRARY:

BLOB is wizardly. 
BLOB is life. 
BLOB is a single class.
BLOB is a flexible container that operates on arbitrarily nested Maps, Lists, Sets, and primitives.  
BLOB is an API for reading/writing/manipulating YAML/JSON files.

YAML is a spiffy, lightweight markup language that makes the kind of flexible,
easy-to-read configuration files that make XML users feel bad about themselves.
However, because YAML produces nested object collections that are difficult to
navigate in a statically-typed language, it was not until the PROMETHIAN INVENTION 
of BLOB that the full POWER OF YAML was given unto mankind.

This library combines SnakeYAML, an open-source YAML library, with BLOB,
a custom data container class. SnakeYAML provides a means for reading and writing to 
YAML files, while BLOB provides THE MOST CONVENIENT  means for manipulating such data
KNOWN TO MAN OR WOMAN! In the distribution jar, SnakeYAML and BLOB are combined into a 
single library for convenience. While this would normally be considered horrible practice, 
there is LITERALLY NO REASON IN THE WORLD to use SnakeYAML without BLOB. 

YAML is a superset of JSON. YOU CAN USE THIS LIBRARY TO READ JSON FILES.
