THE BLOB LIBRARY:

BLOB is a single class.
BLOB is a flexible container that operates on arbitrarily nested Maps, Lists, Sets, and primitives.  
BLOB is an API for reading/writing/manipulating YAML/JSON files.
BLOB is wizardly. 
BLOB is life. 

YAML is a lightweight markup language that makes the kind of flexible,
easy-to-read config files that make XML users feel bad about themselves.
However, YAML produces nested object collections that are extremely annoying
to deal with in statically-typed languages. It was not until the PROMETHIAN INVENTION 
of BLOB that the full POWER OF YAML was given unto statically-typed-language-using
part of mankind.

This library combines SnakeYAML, an open-source YAML library, with BLOB,
a custom data container class. SnakeYAML provides a means for reading and writing to 
YAML files, while BLOB provides THE MOST CONVENIENT  means for manipulating such data
KNOWN TO MAN OR WOMAN! In the distribution jar, SnakeYAML and BLOB are combined into a 
single library for convenience. While this would normally be considered horrible practice, 
there is LITERALLY NO REASON IN THE WORLD to use SnakeYAML without BLOB. 

YAML is a superset of JSON. YOU CAN USE THIS LIBRARY TO READ JSON FILES.
