### Blob

BLOB is a single class.  
BLOB is a flexible container that operates on nested Maps, Lists, Sets, and primitives.  
BLOB is an API for reading/writing/manipulating YAML/JSON files.  
BLOB is wizardly.  
BLOB is life.  

Blob is container class for reading/writing/manipulating YAML data.
YAML is a lightweight markup language that makes XML users feel bad about themselves. 
However, it produces nested object collections that can be extremely annoying to deal with in java. 
It was not until the PROMETHIAN INVENTION of BLOB that the full POWER OF YAML was given unto 
statically-typed-language-using part of mankind.

This library includes SnakeYAML, an open-source YAML library, with BLOB,
a custom data container class. SnakeYAML provides a means for reading and writing to 
YAML files, while BLOB provides THE MOST CONVENIENT means for manipulating such data
KNOWN TO MAN OR WOMAN! 

YAML is a superset of JSON. YOU CAN USE THIS LIBRARY TO READ JSON FILES. 
For writing to JSON, another library would be needed.
